Baseline push-only version of ligra and gap applications.

**NOTE** We have made a small modification to the ligra framework to 
allow all applications to use the `dense-write` execution mode every 
iteration.

The modification does not affect runtime of baseline ligra implementations
(Less than 2% difference in runtime)
