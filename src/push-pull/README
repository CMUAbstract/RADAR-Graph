Enhancing the baseline versions of `push-new-orig` with the push-pull
direction-switching optimization.

NOTE: Ligra applies the push-pull optimization by default for most
applications 

NOTE2: Due to the completely symmetric nature of the `tc_local` 
application, executing the application in the pull mode would result
in exactly the same execution
